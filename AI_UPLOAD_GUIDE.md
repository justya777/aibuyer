## 📋 **Material Reference Patterns**

The AI understands these reference patterns:

### **Campaign-Level Assignment**
- `"use IMG_4941.mp4 for first campaign"`
- `"first campaign should use business_video.mp4"`
- `"assign fashion_image.jpg to campaign 2"`

### **AdSet-Level Assignment**  
- `"for adset 1 use IMG_2333.mp4"`
- `"adset 2 should use promo_video.mp4"`
- `"use finance_banner.png for adset 3"`

### **Flexible References**
- `"IMG_4941.mp4"` - System finds and uses this file
- `"business_video"` - Partial filename matching  
- `"promo.mp4"` - Extension-based matching

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Features**

### **Smart Material Matching**
- **Exact filename match**: `IMG_4941.mp4` → finds exact file
- **Partial matching**: `business_video` → finds `business_video.mp4`

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

```
✅ Good filenames:
- IMG_fashion_men_25.jpg
- business_promo_video.mp4  
- investment_banner_women.png

❌ Avoid:
- DSC_001.jpg (unclear content)
- video.mp4 (too generic)
- untitled.png (no context)
```

### **Command Structure**
```
✅ Clear assignments:
"Create 3 campaigns:
1. Men's fashion - use mens_fashion.jpg
2. Women's fashion - use womens_fashion.jpg  
3. Unisex items - use unisex_promo.mp4"

❌ Ambiguous:
"Create campaigns with fashion images"
```

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Upload first**: Upload all materials before writing command
- **Reference clearly**: Use exact filenames for best matching
- **Check uploads**: Verify green indicators before sending
